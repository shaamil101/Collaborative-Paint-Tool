## Description
:paintbrush: I built a collaborative graphical editor â€” akin to Google Docs' ability to have multiple simultaneous editors of the same document. In both cases, multiple clients connect to a server, and whatever editing any of them does, the others see. So I can add an ellipse, a friend on another computer can recolor and move it, etc. In addition to being collaborative, the graphical editor is more functional than the short assignment version (and for extra credit, you can flesh it out even more), in that it handles multiple objects at a time, and can draw rectangles, line segments, and "freehand" shapes in addition to ellipses.
